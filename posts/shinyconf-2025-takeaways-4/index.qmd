# My Takeaways From the ShinyConf2025: Real World Use Cases

![](thumbnail.jpg){width="800"}

I usually tend to have some of my side projects not so related to real world use cases as it's also a way for me to explore new things without much constraints & requirements and then - *in a later step* - reuse what I've learned from them to solve real world issues.

But I have also always been someone who could literally feel the pains in our daily life at work and could never accept that in so many cases they are left unanswered.

For these reasons, I loved the opportunity we had to discover so many real life use cases & projects with which we can link our own daily challenges.

I spent most of my career working with big companies from the industry, transportation & logistic fields, where the big players have a quasi-monopoly role. As we are today experiencing challenging times when independence, sovereignty & resilience have become critical topics, I was particularly happy to observe various practical use cases about R Shiny adoption beyond the traditional Science / Pharma domains.

In particular, examples about switching from proprietary software & platforms like *PowerBI* to R & Shiny were very convincing (I'm thinking about a dedicated / longer post on this topic).

Here are the examples I've chosen, but so many others could be cited:

-   "*Building [Elkem](https://www.elkem.com/)'s R Universe, One Package at a Time*" by [Recle Vibal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/recleev) & [Kjell HÃ¥kon Berget](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kjell-h%C3%A5kon-berget-b8bba33/)

-   "*Streamlining Portfolio Management with Shiny*" by [Ashley Dennie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-dennie/)

-   "*Joel's Air Quality Application*" by [Joel Duah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-duah-b07714115/)

-   "*Unified Innovation: How We Started Our Shiny DevOps Journey*" by [Liz Whelan-Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-whelan-jackson-8b5944129/)

What real world use case or daily pain would you solve with the lessons learned from the conference?
