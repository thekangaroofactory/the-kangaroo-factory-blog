# Mastering Communication between Shiny Modules is out!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

One of the greatest challenges faced while thinking and developing the architecture of modular R/Shiny apps is the communication between the different modules and the main application server.

Especially when the apps have multiple data sources or are getting more features that can not only consume but also modify the data.

My overall feeling is that thereâ€™s a lack of documentation out of the basic examples in this domain and I had to spend a lot of time exploring how the communication *actually* works.

I hope this guide will help you put all the pieces together, and help us all make smart choices.

Link to the GitHub repository with all the examples: \
<https://github.com/thekangaroofactory/template-r-shiny-communication>

Or course, feel free to contact me if you have additional use cases that could be covered in this guide.\
Also both GitHub repositories can get issues for things to fix & typos.
