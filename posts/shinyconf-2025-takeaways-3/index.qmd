# My Takeaways From the ShinyConf2025: Data Visualization & User Experience

![](thumbnail.jpg)

Because I love Data Visualization as well as app & dashboard design, I'm always happy to look for ways to improve my knowledge in this domain and get inspired by others work.

I have also experienced situation where the technical features of a product were not sufficient to build adoption because of the global user experience. As we are all primarily focused on the data analysis & processing, we should not forget that *how* the output is perceived by the users is a big part of the success of any product.

Interactive Data Visualization is definitely one key topic on my open source roadmap as I had the opportunity to witness how powerful it can be from licensed softwares (plot interactivity is a native feature in *PowerBI* for example).

In addition to that, I encountered some challenges in the recent days that were addressed during the conference. In particular, I built a prototype to automate the production of a profile / resume from plain text and ran into many issues while trying to get homogenized results with HTML, pdf & Word file formats.

My choices (of course excluding my own session) for this domain:

-   *"Theming Made Easy: Introducing [brand.yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) for Shiny"* by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/)\
    No doubt that this approach could help homogenizing look & feel beyond branding[^1]

-   "*The '[ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/)' Cookbook: Recipes for Interactive and Performant Shiny Visualizations*" by [Ardata](https://www.ardata.fr/)\
    It's been a long time since I've put the package documentation page in my browser's favorite, but this introduction actually make me want to allow more time to explore it.

-   {bslib} in general, I could observe during the session that several projects & dashboards rely on this package to implement *Boostrap* cards & layout to produce modern design and navigation experience.

[^1]: After my session, I got several comments & questions about how I handled to make the plots fit with the global {bslib} theme.
